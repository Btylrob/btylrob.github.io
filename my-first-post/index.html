    This is my first post in the brand new soupault blog. Itâ€™s really interesting, except for its
introductory paragraph of course. That one is boring and should never be displayed on the front page.

    About Me
   </h1>
   <p>
    Hi, Iâ€™m Brandon, Computer Science and Statistics student at FIU.
   </p>
   <p>
    I enjoy quiet mornings with my dog â€” and with Vim ðŸ˜‰. I appreciate
clarity, both in thought and in conversation, and Iâ€™m often more
interested in asking the right question than giving the perfect
answer.
   </p>
   <p>
    Right now, Iâ€™m working at Walmart in the meat department, and on the
side, Iâ€™m also building a website for a rising local pop art creator â€” a
project Iâ€™m really excited about and would love to share with you
soon.

    Where Iâ€™m At
   </h2>
   <p>
    Right now, Iâ€™m in a season of learning, observing, and building
things slowly. I try to stay offline as much as possible, because I have
a tendency to compare myself to others instead of focusing on my own
path.
   </p>
   <p>
    Iâ€™m in the process of laying the foundation for my own kingdom. This
year, my focus is on working in silence, speaking less, and letting
results speak for themselves.
   </p>
   <p>
    At the moment, Iâ€™m learning Vim macros, system architecture, Jenkins,
and clean Python.
   </p>

    If Youâ€™re Here
   </h2>
   <p>
    Thanks for stopping by. I donâ€™t post often, but when I do, itâ€™s
usually because something stuck in my head long enough to need writing
it down. I donâ€™t have answers, but I like thinking out loud.
   </p>

    If anything here resonates, feel free to say hello.

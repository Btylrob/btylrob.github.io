    FPGAs in 2025... What is a FPGA?, Why now?, Steps for Success.
   </p>
   <h2>
    🧭 Introduction
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     What is an FPGA? FPGA (Field Programmable Array) is a type of
integrated ciruit that can be reprogrammed and reprogrammed by the user
after manufactured. In short words unlike ASICs (Application Specific
Integrated Circuits), can only be programmed once and are fixed in
functionality.
    </li>
    <li>
     Why am I learning FPGAs in 2025? I got interested in learning FPGAs
after learning about logic gates in discrete math class, I found it
quite interesting and also wanted to understand software - hard ware
interaction.

    <li>
     Real-world applications (e.g., robotics, AI, hardware
acceleration)

    👨‍💻 My First FPGA Project
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Definetly gonna go the route of the typical blinking light on an
FPGA board, however I also want to test FPGA board abilities on low
latency programming and real time application. Although FPGA boards are
not ideal for everyday task, it is faster for specialized applications
more than a GPU and CPU due to higher processing power.

    🚀 Next Steps
   </h2>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Understand difference in FPGA and CPUs
    </li>
    <li>
     Write basic logic using Verilog
    </li>
    <li>
     Deploy Simple Designs
    </li>
    <li>
     Apply knowledge to real time market analyzer project
    </li>

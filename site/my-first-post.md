# My first post

<time id="post-date">1970-01-01</time>

This is an introductory paragraph. Itâ€™s long and only interesting for the really dedicated readers.
Everyone else will just skip it.

<p id="post-excerpt">
This is my first post in the brand new soupault blog. Itâ€™s really interesting, except for its
introductory paragraph of course. That one is boring and should never be displayed on the front page.

# About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Brandon, Computer Science and Statistics student at FIU.

I enjoy quiet mornings with my dog â€” and with Vim ðŸ˜‰. I appreciate clarity, both in thought and in conversation, and Iâ€™m often more interested in asking the right question than giving the perfect answer.

Right now, Iâ€™m working at Walmart in the meat department, and on the side, Iâ€™m also building a website for a rising local pop art creator â€” a project Iâ€™m really excited about and would love to share with you soon.

## Where Iâ€™m At

Right now, Iâ€™m in a season of learning, observing, and building things slowly. I try to stay offline as much as possible, because I have a tendency to compare myself to others instead of focusing on my own path.

Iâ€™m in the process of laying the foundation for my own kingdom. This year, my focus is on working in silence, speaking less, and letting results speak for themselves.

At the moment, Iâ€™m learning Vim macros, system architecture, Jenkins, and clean Python.

## If You're Here

Thanks for stopping by. I donâ€™t post often, but when I do, itâ€™s usually because something stuck in my head long enough to need writing it down. I donâ€™t have answers, but I like thinking out loud.

If anything here resonates, feel free to say hello.

Well, I mean it would be interesting if there was any content in this post. Sadly, there isnâ€™t,
so itâ€™s no better than its introductory paragraph.

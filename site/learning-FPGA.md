FPGAs in 2025... What is a FPGA?, Why now?, Steps for Success.
</p>

## üß≠ Introduction
- What is an FPGA?
  FPGA (Field Programmable Array) is a type of integrated ciruit that can be reprogrammed and reprogrammed by the user after manufactured.
  In short words unlike ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits), can only be programmed once and are fixed in functionality. 
- Why am I learning FPGAs in 2025?
  I got interested in learning FPGAs after learning about logic gates in discrete math class, I found it quite interesting and also wanted to understand software - hard  ware interaction.
- Real-world applications (e.g., robotics, AI, hardware acceleration)


## üõ†Ô∏è Shopping Cart
- [FPGA Board](https://digilent.com/shop/products/fpga-boards/?srsltid=AfmBOoqUEWD-ByfBFJ1EVhbASfBf-DqCViV65xdYZo-2hyxeh1PNL0Cq)... Still looking at options will update  late

- [Bread Board](https://www.amazon.com/ELEGOO-Breadboard-Solderless-Breadboards-Electronics/dp/B0CYPVMK9J?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&psc=1&smid=A2WWHQ25ENKVJ1&gQT=1) This will help me learn how to blink lights ;)


## üë®‚Äçüíª My First FPGA Project
- Definetly gonna go the route of the typical blinking light on an FPGA board, however I also want to test FPGA board abilities on low latency programming and real time  application. Although FPGA boards are not ideal for everyday task, it is faster for specialized applications more than a GPU and CPU due to higher processing power.

## üöÄ Next Steps
- Understand difference in FPGA and CPUs
- Write basic logic using Verilog
- Deploy Simple Designs
- Apply knowledge to real time market analyzer project

## üìù Conclusion

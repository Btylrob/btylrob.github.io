This is my first post in the brand new soupault blog. It’s really interesting, except for its
introductory paragraph of course. That one is boring and should never be displayed on the front page.

## 🧭 Introduction
- What is an FPGA?
- Why am I learning FPGAs in 2025?
- Real-world applications (e.g., robotics, AI, hardware acceleration)

## 🧠 Basics of FPGA Technology
- FPGA vs. CPU vs. GPU: Key differences
- Understanding logic gates and digital circuits
- What is an HDL (Hardware Description Language)?
  - VHDL vs. Verilog

## 🛠️ Essential Tools and Hardware
- Popular development boards (e.g., Digilent Basys 3, Intel/Altera DE10-Nano)
- Required software (Vivado, Quartus, etc.)
- Simulators and online tools (e.g., EDA Playground)

## 👨‍💻 My First FPGA Project
- Hello World in Verilog: Blinking an LED
- Step-by-step setup and deployment
- Debugging tips and common pitfalls

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Understanding FSMs (Finite State Machines)
- Exploring softcore processors (e.g., MicroBlaze, Nios II)
- Introduction to SystemVerilog

## 📝 Conclusion
- Summary of key takeaways
- Encouragement to experiment and build
- Tease future advanced topics (e.g., HLS, SoC design, FPGA AI)
